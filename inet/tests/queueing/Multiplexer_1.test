%description:

In this test, packets are produced periodically (randomly) by several active
packet sources (ActivePacketSources). The packets are consumed by a single passive
packet sink upon arrival (PassivePacketSink). The single sink is connected to the
multiple sources using an intermediary component (PacketMultiplexer) which simply
forwards packets.
