This folder contains the NS3 vs INET 802.11 validation tests.
-------------------------------------------------------------

The tested scenarios should run in both simulators through the same trajectories 
generating exactly the same packets at exactly the same time. Both simulator
must be instrumented to generate the required log files for the comparison.
NS3 must be patched while INET should be built with the NS3_VALIDATION macro defined.

Steps to run the tests:

 - Make sure you are running OMNeT++ 5.0 or later (will NOT work properly with 4.6).
 - Download ns3.24.1 and extract it into a directory of your choice.
 - Create a symlink named 'ns3' in this folder pointing to your NS3 installation folder
 - Copy ns3-inet-validation-XXXXX.patch to the ns3 directory and patch the sources with
   $ patch -p1 <ns3-inet-validation-XXXXX.patch
 - Rebuild INET with the -DNS3_VALIDATION macro added to the CFLAGS variable.
   To do this, uncomment the appropriate line in 'src/makefrags'.
 - Compile NS3 using the official mechanism (./build.py --enable-examples)
 - Execute 'runtest *.test' to run all tests
