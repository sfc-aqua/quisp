A network consisting of three routers, a server and several clients
can be used to simulate traffic between multiple clients and a server.
Various parameters affecting the simulation can be configured in
the omnetpp.ini.

IP addresses and routing tables are set up automatically, by using
the FlatNetworkConfigurator module.
