In this example the network consists of one client, one router, one internal
server and one external (real) server.

The client sends 100 MB of data to the external server using TCP for uplink traffic.
For downlink traffic the external server may send data to the internal server.

To run this example:

- For uplink traffic use e.g. FileZilla and setup your external server to
  listen on port 10021.
- For downlink traffic use e.g. Iperf with following command line:
  iperf -c 172.0.1.111 -P 1 -i 1 -m -p 10021 -M 1452.0B -l 100.0M -f m -t 0

IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files.
