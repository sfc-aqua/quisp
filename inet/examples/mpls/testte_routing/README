The MPLS/RSVP-TE/LDP protocol models have been revised and mostly rebuilt
from scratch by Vojta Janota since the INET-20050922 release. This network
already features the new simulation models.

This is a sample to demonstrate various routing mechanism.

Following description refers to the nam trace file genereated by the simulation
run.

Three LSPs are established on simulation startup.

The green path uses explicit routing with every hop on the path being listed
explicitly.

The orange one uses explicit routing but only some of the hops are specified
(1-6-5 in this case).

The brown path uses hop-by-hop routing.
