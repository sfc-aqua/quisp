The MPLS/RSVP-TE/LDP protocol models have been revised and mostly rebuilt
from scratch by Vojta Janota since the INET-20050922 release. This network
already features the new simulation models.

This is a sample to demonstrate LSR failure handling.

Following description refers to the nam trace file genereated by the simulation
run.

Green LSP is established as a part of the initial configuration. Later, one of
the routers lying on the green path crashes. This crash is detected by the RSVP
HELLO mechanism by its upstream neighbour and PathErr is sent and propagates to
the LSP ingress node. The ingress router tears down the now non-working path.
Later when LSR4 becomes operational again, the path is re-created by the
signalling module (since it is marked as permanent in the traffic database).
