The MPLS/RSVP-TE/LDP protocol models have been revised and mostly rebuilt
from scratch by Vojta Janota since the INET-20050922 release. This network
already features the new simulation models.

This example network demonstrates work in progress aimed (by Andras Varga)
at reducing the need for writing routing table files (.rt/.irt) for each
router in RSVP-TE simulations, by using the NetworkConfigurator module.
An alternative of this (for large network models) is to generate the routing
table files e.g. by a Perl script.
