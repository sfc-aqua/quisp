The MPLS/RSVP-TE/LDP protocol models have been revised and mostly rebuilt
from scratch by Vojta Janota since the INET-20050922 release. This network
already features the new simulation models.

This is a sample to demonstrate label stacking used for creating tunnel
hierarchy.

Following description refers to the nam trace file genereated by the simulation
run.

Both green and brown LSPs are tunneled through the orange tunnel.

IMPORTANT: In this scenario, the Label Information Base (LIB) of all routers is
configured explicitly (LSR*_lib.xml) when the simulation starts. To my best
knowledge, the RSVP-TE itself does not support creation of tunnel hierarchy
(correct me if I'm wrong: vojta at pohoda dot cz).
