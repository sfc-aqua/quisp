This example demonstrates the automatic routing table configuration features of
the IPv4NetworkConfigurator. The example demonstrates the IPv4NetworkConfigurator
features on a complex network that contains both wired and wireless nodes.

In the example, there are two completely separate wireless networks and some wired
nodes. The source node sends ping packets to the wireless and wired interfaces of
the destination node. The routing tables are set up in the following way. The ping
packets reach the wireless destination interface while going through both wireless
networks and one shared wired link. On the other hand, the ping packets reach the
wired destination interface using only wired links, including the shared wired link.
