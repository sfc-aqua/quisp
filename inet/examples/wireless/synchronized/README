This example demonstrates the anomalies that may be caused by
generating wireless traffic in a synchronized way.

Several wireless hosts communicate with UDP packats in an adhoc
network in two different scenarios. In the synchronized scenario
all message sends collide and fail. This happens because all hosts
start transmitting at the very same simulation time and this is
repeated over and over again. The non-synchronized scenario solves
this problem by introducing a random delay in the application level.
