This example demonstrates the use of multiple radio interfaces in a 
single node (router). There are two wireless networks running on 
different channels. 

The two networks can be connected either via the Access Points using
an ethernet link or via a wireless router that has two radio interfaces. 
The routing table is configured to pass packets between the networks.
