Demonstrates how Ethernet works with IP. Ethernet interfaces of hosts and
routers (eth[0], eth[1] etc.) consist of EtherMAC, EtherEncap and ARP.
Note that as the client host opens a TCP connection to the server, Proxy ARP
requests are made to find the router.

ARP operation can be followed by peeking into ARP packets, and examining
the log from ARP either in the main window, or better, by opening text
output windows for individual ARP modules (right-click the ARP module, then
select Module Output... from the context menu).
