OSPFv2 Routing

The OSPFv2 module is a cleanroom implementation of the OSPFv2 routing
protocol (rfc 2328), programmed by Andras Babos. This work is currently
in progress, and there are known bugs, mostly associated with unnumbered
interfaces -- they will be corrected in subsequent INET Framework releases.

This example simulation has been used to test the OSPF model during
development.
