This example demonstrates the automatic routing table configuration features of
the IPv4NetworkConfigurator. The example focuses on the basic settings, one by
one.

In this example, there are 4 nodes connected with each other in a square.
Each node sends ping packets to all interfaces. Each configuration section
demonstrates a single automatic routing table configuration feature.
