The same network (consisting of three routers, a server and several clients)
can be simulated with three different kinds of traffic:

 - Telnet sessions, using the TelnetApp and TCPGenericSrvApp modules;

 - web users issuing HTTP requests, using the TCPBasicCliApp and
   TCPGenericSrvApp modules;

 - file transfer sessions, using the TCPBasicCliApp and TCPGenericSrvApp
   modules with a different configuration.

IP addresses and routing tables are set up automatically, by using
the FlatNetworkConfigurator module.
