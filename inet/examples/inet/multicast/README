Multicast Routing Example

This network consists of four router and six hosts. It shows routing behavior
with preconfigured static routes for unicast and multicast datagrams.
Multicast datagrams are duplicated by the router only if there is a group
member in the subnet. Therefore, there is no generation of redundant or
unnecessary data packets.

The hosts run a simple application which sends UDP packets to randomly
chosen hosts or multicast groups.

The connection between router2 and router4 deliberately has a small MTU,
so that we can observe fragmentation.
