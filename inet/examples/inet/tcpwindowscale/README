In this example the network consists of one client and one server.
IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files.

The client sends 1000 MB of data to the server using TCP.

The channel between client and server has a high bandwidth-delay product (LFN).

Different configurations illustrate the performance gain achievable by using
the Window Scale header option (RFC 1323).
