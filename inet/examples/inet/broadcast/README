This example demonstrates network directed broadcast. "client" periodically
sends UDP packets to the 10.0.1.255 destination address, i.e. to the
broadcast address of the 10.0.1.x subnet. (Client itself is outside this
network, because of the way the configurator assigns addresses by default:
each link, i.e. each LAN, becames a different subnet).

When packets arrive at the router of the 10.0.1.x subnet (R2), the router
will broadcast the packet on the LAN, and so all "target" hosts will
receive it.
