In this example the network consists of one client and one server only
and demonstrates how to use different TCP implementations on different hosts
in the same network.

The default TCP implementation can be replaced using the StandardHost's tcpType 
parameter. This example uses the Network Simulation Cradle library which contains
real-world tcp implementations taken from Linux 2.6, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and lwIP.
It can be downloaded from: http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2/nsc/

The NSC library must be present in <inet_root>/3rdparty/nsc-0.5.1 directory.

To successfully build INET with NSC support you must first compile the NSC libraries
in 3rdparty/nsc-0.5.1 . 
Execute:

  $ python scons.py

The build process will create several TCP stack implementations as shared libraries.

Build INET:

  $ make clean
  $ make
