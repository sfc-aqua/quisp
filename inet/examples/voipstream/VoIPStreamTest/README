VoIPToolTest
============

This is basic test network for VoIP testing. It contains two hosts connected
via two routers and a switch. The hosts have a VoIP session set up between them.
One host (the "server") transmits the contents of an audio file to the other 
(the "client"), which records it to a file. The two files can then be compared
for sound quality.
