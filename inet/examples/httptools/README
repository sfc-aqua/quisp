HttpTools Examples
==================

pair-direct
-----------

Pairs scenario for direct message passing. Scripted browsing and site used for repeatable results.
The scenario consists of one browser and one server.
Initialization files:
  - scripted.ini        : Requests for two existing pages from the server. One has a number of resource references.
  - scripted-bad.ini    : Requests for a number of non-existent pages from the server.
  - scripted-cross.ini  : Request for a page with an embedded reference to a resource on another site.


pair-socket
-----------

Pairs scenario consisting of one browser and one server, directly connected using a TCP/IP link. 
Scripted browsing and site used for repeatable results. See the pair-direct scenario for discussion on the scripts.


simple-direct-ddos
------------------

Simple DDoS scenario consisting of a browser, a victim server (www.good.com) and two attackers (www.bad.org
and www.ugly.org). The attackers serve HTML code containing embedded references to resources on www.good.com.
The result is a DDoS attack on www.good.com. See the API documentation for further details on the attacks.


simple-socket-ddos
------------------

A simple DDoS scenario similar to the direct version. A router and TCP/IP links are added.


nnodes-socket
-------------

A simple sockets example with variable number of browsers and servers. The servers are connected to one router, 
while the browsers use another one. A single leg connects the routers, producing a "dumbbell" topology.


10servers-socket
----------------

A sockets example consisting of ten servers and a variable number of browsers. The same dumbbell topology is used
as in nnodes-socket. This scenario demonstrates the use of the controller component to select servers on behalf of
browsers in random browsing mode, using three different popularity distributions:
  - omnetpp.ini :  Uniform server popularity distribution used.
  - zipf.ini:      Zipf server popularity distribution used.
  - histogram.ini: A histogram popularity distribution used.


flash-direct
------------

A direct message passing scenario involving ten servers and a number of browsers. A popularity modification event is
triggered at 6 hours, by means of a script read by the controller. The server www.abc.com should see a significant
rise in popularity at that time. The popularity is gradually decreased -- or amortized -- by the amorization constant
specified in the script.
