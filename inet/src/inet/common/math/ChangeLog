	Added a new generic and efficient multidimensional mathematical function API.
	This API is mostly useful for the physical layer signal processing.

	Added core classes are Point, Interval, and Domain.
	Added core interfaces are IInterpolator and IFunction.

	Added interpolators are EitherInterpolator, LeftInterpolator, RightInterpolator,
	MinimumInterpolator, MaximumInterpolator, AverageInterpolator, CloserInterpolator,
	LinearInterpolator and LineardbInterpolator.

	Added primitive functions are ConstantFunction, UnilinearFunction, BilinearFunction,
	UnireciprocalFunction, Boxcar1DFunction, Boxcar2DFunction, GaussFunction,
	SawtoothFunction, Interpolated1DFunction, and PeriodicallyInterpolated1DFunction.

	Added algebraic function operations are AddedFunction, SubtractedFunction,
	MultipliedFunction, DividedFunction, and SummedFunction.

	Added function compositors are DomainLimitedFunction, DomainShiftedFunction,
	DomainModulated2DFunction, ValueTruncatedFunction, MemoizedFunction, Combined2DFunction,
	ApproximatedFunction, Extruded2DFunction, and IntegratedFunction.
