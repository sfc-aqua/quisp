// This module is a generic request/response based server application. For each
// request it receives, it generates a different traffic based on the data the
// request contains. The client application can be any source that is capable
// of generating packets with different data. The first byte of the packet data
// determines the response traffic, which can be configured to produce complex
// streams of packets with various data and timing distributions.
