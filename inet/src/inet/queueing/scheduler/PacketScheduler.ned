//
// This module connects one packet collector to multiple packet providers. It
// can be popped for packets by the connected packet collector. When this
// happens, the scheduler pops a packet from one of its packet providers based
// on the configured scheduler function. The packet scheduler function takes a
// list of packet providers and returns an integer which in turn is used for
// determining the input gate.
//
simple PacketScheduler extends PacketSchedulerBase like IPacketScheduler
{
    parameters:
        string schedulerClass; // determines the input queue of the packet, the parameter must be the name of a C++ class which implements the IPacketSchedulerFunction interface and is registered via Register_Class
        @class(PacketScheduler);
}
