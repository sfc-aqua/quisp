	Added a new queueing package which replaces the old queue package. This new
	package comes with a different API and a lot of new components. All old queue
	components were either ported or completely replaced with components of the new
	queueing package.

	Added new NED simple modules: MarkovClassifier, LabelClassifier, PacketClassifier,
	PriorityClassifier, WrrClassifier, UserPriorityClassifier, and ContentBasedClassifier.
