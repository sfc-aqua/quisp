// This module interface is implemented by packet filter modules. A packet filter
// connects one input to one output. It can operate in both active and passive
// mode. Packets can be pushed into its input or packets can be popped from its
// output. Processed packets are either dropped, if they don't match the filter
// criteria, or they are passed through without any delay or reordering.
