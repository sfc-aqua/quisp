//
// This module interface is implemented by packet meter modules. A packet meter
// connects one input to one output. It can operate in both active and passive
// mode. Packets can be pushed into its input or packets can be popped from its
// output. When processing packets, a meter attaches some information (such as
// the packet rate) to the packets based on the data and meta data they contain.
// The packets are processed as part of a stream.
