// This module filters for packets matching the configured filter criteria.
// When the filter is pushed by a connected packet producer, it either pushes
// the packet to the connected packet consumer or drops it depending on the
// configured packet filter. Similarily, when the filter is popped by a connected
// packet collector, it pops packets from the connected packet provider until
// it finds one which matches the configured packet filter.

        string packetFilter = default("*"); // packet filter expressions (e.g. ping-*), matches all packets by default
        string packetDataFilter = default("*"); // packet data filter expression (e.g. inet::Ipv4Header and srcAddress = "10.0.0.1"), matches all packets by default
