//
// This module filters for packets matching the configured filter criteria.
// When the filter is pushed by a connected packet producer, it either pushes
// the packet to the connected packet consumer or drops it depending on the
// configured packet filter. Similarily, when the filter is popped by a connected
// packet collector, it pops packets from the connected packet provider until
// it finds one which matches the configured packet filter.
//
simple PacketFilter extends PacketFilterBase like IPacketFilter
{
    parameters:
        string filterClass; // determines the packets which pass the filter, the parameter must be the name of a C++ class which implements the IPacketFilterFunction interface and is registered via Register_Class
        @class(PacketFilter);
}
