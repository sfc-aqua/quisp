About INET Showcases
====================

This folder contains the INET showcase simulations and the source code of their
associated web pages. Media files (images and videos) for the pages are
in a separate repository (https://github.com/inet-framework/media)
to keep the core  INET repository small; that repo needs to be checked out
under $INET/media if you want to build the web pages.

See $INET/doc/src/README for more information on building the documentation.
