Visualization
=============

The INET Framework is able to visualize a wide range of events and conditions
in the network: packet drops, data link connectivity, wireless signal path loss,
transport connections, routing table routes, and many more.
Visualization is implemented as a collection of configurable INET modules that
can be added to simulations at will.

These showcases demonstrate several such visualization possibilities
via practical examples.
